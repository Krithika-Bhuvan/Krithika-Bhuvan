## 🙋‍♀️ About 

Krithika is a Health Data Scientist with over 15 years experience and combines her interdisciplinary skills in health data science, informatics and applied statistics to solve real-world healthcare challenges

Krithika employs machine learning, applied statistics, and systems biology techniques for in-depth analysis. Additionally, she applies her interdisciplinary skills to clean, analyze, interpret and visualize complex biomedical data. Her work also involves using cloud computing (Amazon and Google cloud) and high-performance computing (HPC) for analyzing large-scale data analysis of genomic data. 

## Notable Mentions
* Participated in the **HTAN Data Jamboree**, a hackathon-style team event, where we developed as a team, a multi-agent LLM to enable endusers to easily explore and query spatial transcriptomics data located on the HTAN BigQuery and Synapse platforms (**Nov 2024**).
