## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è About 

Krithika is a Data Scientist and has over 15 years professional work experience and combines her interdisciplinary skills in health data science, informatics and applied statistics for numerous projects. 

Krithika employs machine learning, applied statistics, and systems biology techniques for in-depth analysis. Additionally, she applies her data science skills to clean, manage and analyze clinical and genomic data; and develop new algorithms. Her work also involves using cloud computing (Amazon and Google cloud) and high-performance computing (HPC) for analyzing large-scale data analysis of genomic data. 

## Notable Mentions
* Participated in the **HTAN Data Jamboree**, a hackathon-style team event, where we developed as a team, a multi-agent LLM to enable endusers to easily explore and query spatial transcriptomics data located on the HTAN BigQuery and Synapse platforms (**Nov 2024**).
